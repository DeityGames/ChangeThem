## Description

Change THEM is a game where the player infects a few choice civilians in an attempt to infect the whole population. That'd be easy if it weren't for the soldiers going around and killing the infected. Defeat the soldiers by overwhelming them with numbers or by strategically sacrificing some of your infected. Can you infect all four levels?

## Controls

W, A, S, D or arrow keys to move the camera.

Mouse Wheel to zoom the camera in and out.

Left click to infect civilians and sacrifice zombies.
